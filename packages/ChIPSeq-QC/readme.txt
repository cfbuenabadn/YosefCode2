ChIP-Seq QC Pipeline
------------------------
This program takes ChIP-Seq or ATAC-Seq data as input, aligns it to a reference genome, and provides some summary statistics and QC measures. It can take aligned or unaligned BAMs as input, and also fastq files. The data can be paired or unpaired.


Please see the manual at https://docs.google.com/document/d/1b7U62fktsLxmi3bA_3kHgA5f63O9NtBjgEtOUqtRThs/edit?usp=sharing before running. Afterward, ask Jim (jimkaminski@berkeley.edu) if you have any questions.
