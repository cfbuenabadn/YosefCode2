Overlaps DB 
-------------------------

This program takes (1) a bed file and (2) a list of annotation files as input, and calls bedtools to determine the amount of overlap between the bed file of interest (1) and the gtf and bed files listed in (2).

A manual will be written sometime in May 2015, after I finish my quals. For now, please look at the help statement (run "OverlapDatabase.py -h") and the code itself. I will also put some test data in. Please email me if you have any questions.
